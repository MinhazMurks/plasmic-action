Public plasmic cli for syncing designs to local code.

`plasmic init` creates the initial plasmic.json file, pointing to your local dev host.

`plasmic sync --projects ...` allows you to sync all components in the specified projects

`plasmic sync` from any subfolder of the folder with the `plasmic.json` file.
